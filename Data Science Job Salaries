This file contains SQL Queries used to answer questions about salaries of different Data Science jobs. This analysis aims to answer 5 questions:
1. What is the average salary per data science job? 
2. What are the highest paying entry level data science jobs
3. What is the lowest paying entry level data science job? 
4. Does company location affect salary?
5. Does company size affect salary? 

The data was taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries)


--- 1. What is the average salary per data science job? 
SELECT job_title, ROUND(AVG(salary_in_usd), 2) AS Average_salary
FROM `optical-office-345823.data_salaries.data_salaries`
GROUP BY job_title
ORDER BY average_salary DESC



--- 2. What are the highest paying entry level data science jobs
WITH table1 AS
(SELECT job_title, experience_level, salary_in_usd, 
		RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY job_title, experience_level ORDER BY salary_in_usd DESC) AS job_rank
		 FROM `optical-office-345823.data_salaries.data_salaries`
WHERE experience_level = 'EN')

SELECT job_rank, job_title, experience_level, salary_in_usd
FROM table1
WHERE job_rank = 1
ORDER BY salary_in_usd DESC

Answer: Machine Learning Engineer at $250,000 



--- 3. What is the lowest paying entry level data science job? 
SELECT MIN(salary_in_usd) AS lowest_salary, job_title
FROM `optical-office-345823.data_salaries.data_salaries`
WHERE experience_level = 'EN'
GROUP BY job_title
ORDER BY lowest_salary

Answer: Data Scientist at $4,000 (this appears to be too low; it might be an outlier) 



--- 4. Does company location affect salary? 
SELECT CASE WHEN company_location = 'US' 
		 THEN 'In the US'
		 ELSE 'Not in US' 
		 END AS company_loc_category,
		 ROUND(AVG(salary_in_usd), 2) AS avg_salary

FROM `optical-office-345823.data_salaries.data_salaries`

GROUP BY CASE WHEN company_location = 'US' 
		 THEN 'In the US'
		 ELSE 'Not in US' END
     
Answer: Not in US - Average Salary is $67,560.27
        In US     - Average Salary is $144,055.26
It appears that US companies tend to pay more, with a higher average salary. 



--- 5. Does company size affect salary? 

SELECT CASE WHEN company_size = 'L' THEN 'Large Company'
			      WHEN company_size = 'M' THEN 'Medium Company'
			      WHEN company_size = 'S' THEN 'Small Company'
		 ELSE NULL 
     END AS new_company_size,
		 ROUND(AVG(salary_in_usd), 2) AS avg_salary

FROM `optical-office-345823.data_salaries.data_salaries`

GROUP BY CASE WHEN company_size = 'L' THEN 'Large Company'
			        WHEN company_size = 'M' THEN 'Medium Company'
			        WHEN company_size = 'S' THEN 'Small Company'
		 ELSE NULL END
