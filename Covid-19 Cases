--- Group Number of Global Cases by date
SELECT date, sum(new_cases) as total_cases, sum(new_deaths) as total_deaths, sum(new_deaths)/sum(new_cases)*100 as death_percent
FROM `optical-office-345823.covid19.covid_deaths`
WHERE continent is NOT NULL
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY 1,2


--- Look at countries w/ highest infection rate compared to population
SELECT location, population, MAX(total_cases) as highestinfectioncount, MAX(total_cases/population)*100 as populationinfectedpercent
FROM `optical-office-345823.covid19.covid_deaths`
GROUP BY population, location
ORDER BY populationinfectedpercent DESC


--- Show countries with highest death count per population
SELECT location, MAX(cast(total_deaths as int)) as totaldeathcount
FROM `optical-office-345823.covid19.covid_deaths`
WHERE continent is NOT null
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY totaldeathcount DESC
